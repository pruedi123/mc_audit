"Model Constructions
Model portfolios are constructed in the Returns Program using past data of funds or indices as of a specific date, assigning weights to those funds or indices to equal 100%. The model portfolios constructed are hypothetical and are not representative of actual portfolios. Their performance is hypothetical, for illustrative purposes only and is subject to limitations. Unless otherwise specified by the user, the hypothetical performance is gross of fees and is rebalanced monthly. The performance presented does not replace an advisor's actual model portfolio performance. Past and hypothetical results are no guarantee of future results. The model performance is based on model/back tested asset allocations. The performance was achieved with the retroactive application of a model designed with the benefit of hindsight; it does not represent actual investment performance. Back-tested model performance is hypothetical (does not reflect trading in actual portfolios) and may not reflect the impact that economic and market factors may have had on advisor's decision-making if the advisor were actually managing client money.
